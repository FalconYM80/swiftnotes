# Notes App Frontend

This is the frontend for the Notes App, built with React.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-railway-backend-url.railway.app/api
```
Replace `https://your-railway-backend-url.railway.app` with your actual Railway backend URL.

3. Start the development server:
```
npm start
```

## Authentication

The app includes a complete authentication system:
- User registration
- User login
- Protected routes
- JWT token management

## Features

- Create, read, update, and delete notes
- Notes are associated with the authenticated user

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Troubleshooting

If you experience issues with registration or login:

1. Make sure your backend server is running and accessible
2. Check that your `.env` file has the correct `REACT_APP_API_URL` pointing to your Railway backend
3. Visit `/api-test` route in the app to test API connectivity directly
4. Check browser console for any error messages
5. Ensure CORS is properly configured on your backend

Common issues:
- "Registration failed" - Check if the email is already registered
- Network errors - Verify the API URL is correct and the backend is running
- CORS errors - Make sure your backend allows requests from your frontend domain
